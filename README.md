# Ash's Pizza Shop
#### By Ash Laidlaw

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a fake pizza restaurant. It will use a form to take the order, and allow the "customer" to customize the pizza and order it.

## Get Started

To open the file, either clone the GitHub repository at (https://github.com/Yhbv24/intro-project-4) or visit the GH-Pages site here: (https://yhbv24.github.io/intro-project-4/).

## Specifications

1. Set up menu form with sections for crust style, pizza size, and topping selection.
   * Input: Dropdown selection for crust style, radio buttons pizza size, and checkboxes for toppings.
   * Output: No output at this stage.

2. Upon form submit, gather user data and turn that information into variables.
   * Input: Thin crust, small, pepperoni
   * Output: Pizza.crust = thin, Pizza.size = small, Pizza.toppings = pepperoni

3. Create "Pizza" object, which represents the pizza shop. This object will encapsulate the size, crust, and toppings of the pizza.

4. Create a Pizza.prototype method to determine how much the pizza costs based on the other variables.

5. Once the input data is stored in the variables, call the Pizza.price() method to calculate the price of the pizza.
   * Input: gluten-free crust (50¢), small size ($8), and pepperoni (75¢)
   * Output: Total pizza cost: $9.25

6. Once the total has been calculated, output the result for the customer to see.
